This concept is a reimagination/remaster of the 2007 phone [Sony Ericsson W660i](https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_w660-1924.php).

# Motivation
I wouldn't say that this is anything inovative about this, just pure nostalgia. When I was about 10, I had the Sony Ericsson W660i and still today I think this was one of the most beautiful phones to exist. It was simply an honor to own it. Unfortunately, in the current landscape of tech, this phone is unusable. Since my childhood I've been glued to the 2000s designs of tech - the skeumorphic and gradient graphical user interfaces and the wacky phone designs that were trendy back in the time. Many phones had something unique then, but looking back, it was only natural, because the phone as a device was finding it's identity, it's why everyone was attempting to do something and see how it would work. Now, with touchscreens and phones with no keys and just pure screen, sidebuttons and a camera, there really isn't much you can add that would improve overall basic functionalities of a phone, it's all there. The only thing phones improve nowadays is storage, RAM and camera.

# Software
The phone would run a custom ARM Linux OS (that would be a fork of Alpine Linux) that would be built for this device. This would allow it to easily install and make software for it. The OS' kernel would require the information of the phone's hardware programmed/embedded into it.

## Applications
Preinstalled apps: 
- Web browser (Chromium)
- Camera
- Call application
- Messaging application
- Gallery/Photos application
- File manager
- Terminal emulator

## Root privileges
Root access would be disabled by default.
There would be a terminal program/executable that would be available for download by the manufacturer that would use a special kernel call that is not available elsewhere in the system to trigger the root permission activator.

## Interface
### Functionality
**Home screen / Standby**
The phone has a home screen where user can add widgets such as weather or analog clock.
It should also display some basic information like digital time and date.
User can also apply a wallpaper.

**App menu**
Applications would be organized into categories the same way the original phone was.

**Status bar**
The phone would have a control center that can be activated by swiping down from the top, similarly to Android.

**Customization**
Users can change themes and wallpapers like on the original phone.

### Theme
The phone would have a glassy skeumorphic interface that respects the standards of the era the phone was released in.

# Hardware

## Dimensions
I have no exact dimenions at the moment, but it should be a bit larger or longer than [Samsung Galaxy Y Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_y_pro_b5510-4116.php) so that it could house in a larger display.
The phone needs to have a keyboard and a large enough landscape display so that a user could have enough space.

## Display
The phone would have a landscape display to accomodate the keyboard.

## Keyboard
The phone keypad would be replaced with a keyboard like the Blackerry phones have.
Motive: Better typing and a more satisfying retro experience.

## Camera
The phone would have two front cameras, one normal with 25MP, one wide-angled with 25MP and one macro with 25MP.

## Storage
The phone would have 64GB or 128GB of storage depending on the option.

## Headphone jack
The phone would have a headphone jack at the top in a similar [position](https://free3d.com/3d-model/samsung-galaxy-y-pro-b5510-9422.html) the [Galaxy Y Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_y_pro_b5510-4116.php) houses it.

## Other
- The Walkman button on the phone would be replaced with the button of the same shape, but with an e-ink display that changes to an icon of the app the user would assign. So the app button would basically be changable to anything the user sets.

# Realization
Building custom phones is not an easy task.
