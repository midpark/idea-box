This concept is a reimagination/remaster of the 2007 phone [Sony Ericsson W660i](https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_w660-1924.php).

# Motivation
I wouldn't say that this is anything inovative about this, just pure nostalgia. When I was about 10, I had the Sony Ericsson W660i and still today I think this was one of the most beautiful phones to exist. It was simply an honor to own it. Unfortunately, in the current landscape of tech, this phone is unusable. Since my childhood I've been glued to the 2000s designs of tech - the skeumorphic and gradient graphical user interfaces and the wacky phone designs that were trendy back in the time. Many phones had something unique then, but looking back, it was only natural, because the phone as a device was finding it's identity, it's why everyone was attempting to do something and see how it would work. Now, with touchscreens and phones with no keys and just pure screen, sidebuttons and a camera, there really isn't much you can add that would improve overall basic functionalities of a phone, it's all there. The only thing phones improve nowadays is storage, RAM and camera.

# Software
The phone would run a custom ARM Linux OS (that would be a fork of Alpine Linux) that would be built for this device. This would allow it to easily install and make software for it. The OS' kernel would require the information of the phone's hardware programmed/embedded into it.
## Interface

# Hardware

## Camera
The phone would have two front cameras, one normal with 25MP, one wide-angled with 25MP and one macro with 25MP.

## Storage
The phone would have 64GB or 128GB of storage depending on the option.

## Other
- The Walkman button on the phone would be replaced with the button of the same shape, but with an e-ink display that changes to an icon of the app the user would assign. So the app button would basically be changable to anything the user sets.

# Realization
Building custom phones is not an easy task.
