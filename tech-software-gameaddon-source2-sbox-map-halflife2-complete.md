All maps of Half-Life 2 (including some beta ones), and it's episodes, linked and stiched in a map for S&Box.

# Features
- Ravenholm lake docks
- Trains that take you from City 17 to White Forest and perhaps other cities (that could look like the ones from some beta leaked builds)
- Citadel interiors

# Realization
Half-Life 2's maps when stiched are not aligned properly due to the level designers not strictly following the Euclidean level design principle.
For example, d2_coast_01 collides with d1_town maps. This can be fixed by elongating the tunnel between d1_town_04 and d1_town_05. This will allow Ravenholm to be linked to the d2_coast maps by the lake that appears, right at the back yard of d1_town_01.
