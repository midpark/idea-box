This is a rather *silly* concept I made in PowerPoint, but I really liked graphic design and I had no other means to explore it back then.
It was supposed to be an OS with a similar design to XP and 7 that would feature the same customization abilities like the said OSes.
It was made in late 2017 as a PowerPoint OS and in early 2018. It featured a setup, login screen and a desktop with some applications available like File Explorer, Control Panel and a web browser.
In 2018, the development of it's Visual Studio C# .NET application started that simulated the OS and attempted to make it more functional and almost work as a shell replacement for Windows.

# Appearance
The desktop resembled Windows XP and had a widgets feature. The start menu was also similar to Windows XP. It had a Ribbon UI explorer like Windows 10.
It had another app launcher that was full screen at the top right corner.
It's login screen design was inspired by Windows XP.
It's general appearance is heavily inspired by Windows Aero.
It's logo is the Citadel Core from Half-Life 2: Episode One.
The default wallpaper for Prismin OS was the game screenshot of the Citadel Core reactor from Half-Life 2: Episode One.

# Usability
This OS is useless as it's not an actual OS itself, but rather just a UI/UX conceptualization, similarly to Kopaonik OS.

# Realization
This concept is now slowly merging into several UI component configurations written for Arch Linux: https://github.com/mdpakk/arch-prismin-ux.
It features a very similar looking login screen to Prismin OS.
