This is a concept for the Source 2 engine map for S&Box and it's suitable parkour mod - "MirrorsEdgeTheCityFull".

# Motivation
- Just think how cool it would be if there was some kind of a Parkour server where people can make runner groups and even play as "The Blues" that hunt down the runners!
- Just think how cool it would be if people could roleplay similar scenarios like the one in the ending of Mirror's Edge where you'd have to run to the Shard (the tallest building in the game) to rescue someone by hijacking a helicopter!
- People will be able to re-experience an old classic in an entirely new way.
- So many new running/parkour paths (and time trails) will be made as the players explore the city.
- The map could be used for many other extensible features other users could make.

# Feature concepts
- Trains:
  - Trains can be rideable and hopped on to from New Eden and many other locations in the city.
- Team Runners and Team Blues:
  - People will be able to choose whether they want to hunt down the runners or rebel against the blues.

# Execution
S&Box, a(n) (upcoming) sandbox game using the Source 2 engine, does not have any map size constrains like Source 1 does. So it's theoretically possible to recreate the entire city of Mirror's Edge (2009) in S&Box using it's Hammer editor.
All of the maps in Mirror's Edge can (very likely) be stitched without any overlappings due to it's well Euclidean geometrical consistency across all levels. When selecting maps in Mirror's Edge, the red highlighted part of the map on the menu highlights the location of the chapter in the city as it is shown in game.

## How can level geometry be imported from Mirror's Edge's UE3 to Source 2?
I, myself, don't exactly know, but it's likely possible to export a UE3 level as a 3d model that can be opened in Blender where it can later easily be exported to Source 2.

## Team organization
The creation of this map needs as many team members as possible and definitely needs to be worked on as a group.
