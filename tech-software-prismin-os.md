This is a rather *silly* concept I made in PowerPoint, but I really liked graphic design and I had no other means to explore it back then.
It was supposed to be an OS with a similar design to XP and 7 that would feature the same customization abilities like the said OSes.

This concept is now slowly merging into several UI component configurations written for Arch Linux: https://github.com/mdpakk/arch-prismin-ux
