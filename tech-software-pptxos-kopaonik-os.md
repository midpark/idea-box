A very simple PowerPoint OS that initially started as a Media Hub in Summer 2013 and later renamed to Kopaonik OS in early 2014. It would launch straight to the menu that was similar to the Sony Ericsson's late 2000s phones, except that the layout was landscape rather than vertical since the OS would run on computers.

In the entertainment tab there was a Game Center app that worked similarly to Steam and would allow users to see walkthroughs of games.
In the entertainment tab there was a "Glasovi" (Voices) app that had pictures of people that would play their voice when clicked on the pictures.
In the organizer tab there was a Microsoft Office app that had launchers to it's sub-apps like Word, Powerpoint etc.

# Usability
There is nothing useful about this OS. It's existence is entirely based on my kid curiousity on UI/UX design and wanting to make something funny.
