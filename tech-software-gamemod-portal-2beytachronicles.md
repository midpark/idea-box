**Portal: 2 Beyta Chronicles** is a "Gordon Freakman"-inspired parody mod for Portal (1) with a 95% finished plot. It's plot resolves heavily around the dev's experiences of... the Internet.

The game follows Chell Martinez, the playable character, who after defeating GlaDOS gets trapped back into the relaxation vault. After waking up, it explodes and Chell has to leave the chamber. She later meets Mel, who informs Chell about the war of Combine and their incoming. They escape Aperture science and start looking for Daikuteita, a prototype of a time machine teleporter, that Mel said was needed to debunk Combine propaganda to restore peace. Mel and Chell are forced to escape Aperture Science due to unknown gunmen showing up at it's exterior space. They enter a portal that takes them to another country where they have to find the son of parents who designed Daikuteita. After a lot of pointless struggle, Chell and Mel find Ienis, who takes them to the location of Daikuteita, his old school, where Breen is caught and later escaped and taken to the city venue of the country's capital. There, Chell, Mel and Ienis catch a masked man who was thought to be Breen, but later it turned out to be one of the agents of the League of Karen movements who were secretely all along chasing after Daikuteita to rule all over the country and defeat what they deemed as... "supremacism". It was only found out at the end of the game where Karens League shows up with military planes and helicopters, delivering extra atomic fart bombs that inevitably destroy the city, ending the game.

# Realization
A realization of this game started with Hammer and it's first maps. The brush work of the first part, where Chell navigates through old chambers, was finished, however, due to dev time constrains, the development was halted and it's project files rage deleted.
